This  research  thesis  introduces  an  alternative  approach to the dialect identification work by Hansen et al. (2004) by using contemporary feature extraction and machine learning methods on the dialectical TIMIT data set. Four different feature sets were created based on the A1 and A2 calibration sentences in the TIMIT, which included features from the time, frequency and spectral  domains  to  capture  meaningful  dialectical  information. Multiple experiments were performed with these feature sets andwere  trained  with  established  machine  learning  models  such  as XGBoost,  logistic  regression  and  support  vector  machines.  Finally, a feature importance analysis was performed to determine what extracted characteristics of the audio fragments contributed the  most  to  the  dialect  classification  performance.
